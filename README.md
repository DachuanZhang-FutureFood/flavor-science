# Data-driven elucidation of flavor molecules: Current status and future perspectives


To provide an overview of known flavor molecules, we collected 65,417 data records, containing the molecule names, CAS registry numbers, SMILES, and flavor descriptions, from publicaly available databases. After removing redundancy and molecules with amphibolous description (e.g., sweet-like and non-sweet), we finally collected 8,982 molecules with known taste and 5,046 with known aroma.
