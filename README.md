This repository is a part of the review, Data-driven elucidation of flavor molecules: current status and future perspectives.

To provide an overview of known flavor molecules, we collected 65,417 unique data records from publicaly available databases, containing the molecule names, CAS registry numbers, SMILES, and flavor descriptions. After removing redundancy and molecules with amphibolous description (e.g., sweet-like and non-sweet), we collected 8,982 molecules with known taste and 5,046 with known aroma.
